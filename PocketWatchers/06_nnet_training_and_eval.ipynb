    "### Neural Network vs Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week you learned about Logistic Regression, which is a linear machine learning algorithm. This week we're looking at neural networks (NNets), a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learned from last weeks material, Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the output. This means that it cannot capture the complexity and non-linearity of the data. Another drawback is that it is sensitive to outliers and noise, which can affect the accuracy and stability of the model. Logistic regression also has a limited capacity to learn from multiple features, as it can only combine them linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural network is a type of non-linear model that mimics the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of layers of nodes, also called neurons, that are connected by weights. The input layer receives the input features, and the output layer produces the output. Between them, there are hidden layers that perform computations and transformations on the data. Neural network uses a non-linear activation function to introduce non-linearity and flexibility to the model. Below are some pro's and con's of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Can handle non-linear data better, as it can learn complex and non-linear patterns and relationships from the data.\n",
    "- Can learn from multiple features, as it can combine them in different ways and create new features.\n",
    "- Has a high capacity and scalability, as it can handle large and high-dimensional data and add more layers and nodes as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- More of a blackbox\n",
    "    - Has a low interpretability and transparency, as it is hard to explain how it makes decisions and what are the effects of the weights and layers.\n",
    "- Requires more data and computational resources, as it has more parameters and operations to perform.\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting and underfitting, which means that it can either memorize the training data or fail to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Network vs. Human Brain\n",
    "A neural network is like a simplified version of a human brain, and the basic building block of this network is called a perceptron. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nodes and Neurons:\n",
    "    - **Brain:** In the human brain, you have neurons that receive, process, and transmit information.\n",
    "    - **Neural Network:** In a neural network, you have nodes (or artificial neurons) that do the same job. Each node receives inputs, processes them, and produces an output.\n",
    "2. Inputs and Connections:\n",
    "    - **Brain:** Neurons receive signals from other neurons though connections called synapses\n",
    "    - **Neural Network:** Each node receives inputs, which can come from various sources (like data features or other nodes in the network).\n",
    "3. Weights and Synaptic Strength:\n",
    "    - **Brain:** The connections (synapses) between neurons have different strengths, determining how much influence one neuron has on another.\n",
    "    - **Neural Network:** In a neural network, each input to a node is multiplied by a weight, which determines the importance of that input.\n",
    "4. Summation and Activation:\n",
    "    - **Brain:** A neuron adds up all the incoming signals. If the total is strong enough, the neuron fires and sends a signal forward.\n",
    "    - **Neural Network:** A node also adds up all the weighted inputs. This sum is then passed through an activation function that decides if the node should activate (produce an output).\n",
    "5. Bias:\n",
    "    - **Brain:** Neurons have a threshold they need to reach to fire.\n",
    "    - **Neural Network:** Nodes have a bias term that helps adjust the activation threshold, making the network more flexible.\n",
    "6. Learning and Adjustment:\n",
    "    - **Brain:** Neurons learn and adjust their connections based on experience.\n",
    "    - **Neural Network:** Nodes adjust their weights and biases during training to improve their performance, similar to how neurons adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "A perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network:\n",
    "- It has input nodes that receive data.\n",
    "- These inputs are multiplied by weights and summed up.\n",
    "- A bias term is added to this sum.\n",
    "- The total is passed through an activation function to produce an output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The perceptron learns by adjusting its weights and bias based on the errors it makes, gradually improving its decision-making ability. In essence, a neural network with percetrons mimics the basic functioning of the brain by processing inputs, making decisions, and learning from mistakes.\n",

    "## What is a Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> A neural network (NNet) is a system or hardware that is designed to operate like a human brain. An NNet is usually described as having different layers, where the architecture consists of the following:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input layer:** This layer receives the raw data or features, and each neuron represents an input feature.\n",
    "    - The number of neurons in the input layer is equivalent to the number of features in the data.\n",
    "- **Hidden layer (which we at FICO refer to as Latent Features):** These layers perform complex transformations on the input data.\n",
    "    - A neural network can have multiple hidden layers, and each layer can contain multiple neurons.\n",
    "    - The more hidden layers there are, the more complex the network.\n",
    "    - Helps find relationships between non-linear input fields.\n",
    "- **Output layer:** The final layer provides the network’s predictions or outputs.\n",
    "    - The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the specific problem, such as binary classification, multi-class classification, or regression.\n",
    "- **Neurons:** Each layer has a collection of neurons interacting with neurons in other layers.\n",
    "- **Weight:** Its main function is to give importance to those features that contribute more towards the learning.\n",
    "    - It does so by introducing scalar multiplication between the input value and the weight matrix.\n",
    "- **Bias:** The role of bias is to shift the value produced by the activation function.\n",
    "    - Its role is like the role of a constant in a linear function.\n",
    "- **Activation function:** Performs non-linear transformations to help the model learn complex patterns from the data.\n",

    "    - Train set\n",
    "    - Validation set (which we've been referring to as Test set)\n",
    "3. Normalize (Scale) Features\n",
    "    - Use entire dataset to set scaling and save scaler to scaling file\n",
    "        - Scaling is used to avoid features with larger values having a disproportionate impact on the results\n",
    "        - Use scaler variable on the Train set\n",
    "4. Create DataLoaders and Load Normalized Features\n",
    "    - It is designed to handle large datasets and perform data augmentation, shuffling, and other preprocessing tasks\n",
    "5. Setup NNet\n",
    "    - Define NNet\n",
    "    - Define Loss Function and Optimizer\n",
    "6. Hyper-Parameters\n",
    "    - Define the values for the models internal workings\n",
    "7. Train and Evaluate Model\n",
    "    - Train the model using the Train set and evaluate it using the Test sets\n",
    "8. Save Converged Model\n",
    "9. `Predictions on Dataset using Trained Model`\n",
    "    - Use on entire data to get predictions  \n",
    "    - Store predictions into new column\n",
    "    - Convert predictions to **Score outs**\n",
    "10. Export data to CSV\n",
    "    - Export entire dataset, including model predictions to csv to evaluate overall performance\n"

    "### DataLoader: Shuffling (If interested, please read)\n",
    "Shuffling is done during the model training to make sure we aren't exposing our model to the same cycle (order) of data in every epoch, and is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preventing Bias:** Without shuffling, the model might learn patterns based on the order of the data, leading to biased training and potentially poor generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "- **Randomness in Batch Selection:** When training in mini-batches, shuffling ensures that each batch contains a diverse set of samples from the dataset. This randomness helps the model learn more effectively and prevents it from memorizing specific patterns within a batch.\n",
    "- **Improving Generalization:** Shuffling the data helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data by exposing it to a variety of samples during training. This can lead to better performance on validation and test datasets.\n",
    "- **Breaking Patterns:** In some cases, the dataset might have inherent patterns based on the order of samples (e.g., temporal or spatial patterns). Shuffling disrupts these patterns, forcing the model to learn more robust features.\n",
    "- **Avoiding Overfitting:** Shuffling helps to mitigate overfitting by preventing the model from memorizing the specific characteristics of the training data, which may not generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above can be easily handled by using PyTorch's DataLoader. PyTorch's DataLoader is a powerful tool for efficiently loading and processing data for training deep learning models. It provides functionalities for batching, shuffling, and processing data, making it easier to work with large datasets. Before we use the DataLoader, the dataset must be converted to PyTorch tensors, which can be done by passing it to a python class.\n",

    "#### ROC, AUC & LAUC (Partial AUC)\n",
    "AUC (Area Under the Curve) calculations are a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models. The traditional AUC calculates the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, which plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) for all possible threshold values. The value ranges from 0.5 for a random model to 1 for a perfect model, with values closer to 1 indicating better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in real-world applications, the class distribution of the target variable can be **highly imbalanced** (e.g., more non-frauds than frauds), meaning that one class is much more prevalent than the other. In these cases, the traditional AUC score may not provide a good evaluation of the model’s performance as it aggregates the performance overall threshold values and does not account for the imbalance in the class distribution. For instance, the region where FPR is greater than 0.8 involves more than 80% of negative subjects are incorrectly classified as positives: this is unacceptable in many real cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where partial AUCs (referenced at LAUC in this notebook) come into play. Unlike traditional AUC, they focus on a specific region of the ROC curve, providing a more granular evaluation of the model’s performance. This allows for a more accurate evaluation of the model’s performance, especially in cases where the class distribution is highly imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in our fraud detection problem, the partial AUC can be calculated for the region where the FPR is less than a specific value, such as 0.02. This provides an evaluation of the model’s performance at catching fraud instances while ignoring the performance on the majority class instances. This information can be used to make informed decisions about which models to use, how to improve models, and how to adjust the threshold values for predictions. To read more about LAUCs, please refer to the link below.\n",
