The problem with simple \"last hour\" or \"last day\" variables is that you have no knowledge about this customer's habits outside of that specified timeframe. It's possible that the user naturally fluctuates rapidly throughout the day or week, but we're lacking the necessary long-period information. Typically you want the numerator to be something which encapsulates a time over which periodic behaviors can undergo a full cycle. For example: a user's spending habits might correlate with their pay cycle (2 weeks), or paying off their bills such as a car payment or rent (1 month). We don't want these non-fraud behaviors to trigger any alarm in our variables, so we make the numerator long enough for it to average out. On the other hand, we want our denominator to capture several of these cycles to ensure the numerator truly is reflective of that user's spending patterns. Please create at least three ratio variables which capture transaction frequency or spending amount averages. You may want to use rolling windows for these.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['transactionDateTime'])"],"metadata":{"id":"4JBFSKCeo9z2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733366844151,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":112,"user":{"displayName":"Lor_Wavy","userId":"14379482329016137824"}}},"execution_count":110,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":111,"metadata":{"id":"5lkVQupGbEl2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733366844884,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":734,"user":{"displayName":"Lor_Wavy","userId":"14379482329016137824"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Example: rolling mean of last 14 days (2 weeks) vs. rolling mean of last 60 days (2 months)\n","# df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n","df.set_index('datetime', inplace=True)  # Set the date column as the index\n","df['rolling_mean_14D'] = df.groupby('pan')['transactionAmount'].rolling(window='14D', min_periods=1).mean().reset_index(level=0, drop=True)\n","df['rolling_mean_60D'] = df.groupby('pan')['transactionAmount'].rolling(window='60D', min_periods=1).mean().reset_index(level=0, drop=True)\n","df['ratio_14D_to_60D'] = df['rolling_mean_14D'] / df['rolling_mean_60D']\n","df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Fx0CnIEpXftL"},"source":["If you want to alter the range of the window, simply change the window parameter in the rolling function.
